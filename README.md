# BitsORDINAL
Hackathon Oxford Bitso Track Ordinals

OGinal protocol allows people to mint ordinals to record their OGness and loyalty to the Bitcoin network. They will be ranked through a table based on their first transaction date. More features will be added in the future to allow for more criteria to be taken in account.

We use UniSat as an Ordinal Wallet and implemented gasless transactions, to allow users to not pay for the gas.

Show us who is the OGiest !
